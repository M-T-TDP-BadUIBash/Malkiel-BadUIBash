# Bad UI Bash 2022

This is my entry to the M&T Tech Bad UI Bash. This project involves creating awful user interfaces *intentionally*. For this year, our task was to create a resume submission page with a twist.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler Warning (try the project first!)</summary>
  
  - I used a rotary phone emulator from [here](https://github.com/thomaspark/rotary) to make it harder to enter the phone number
  - The submit and Reset buttons are reverse colors, order and only show the text upon hovering on the button.
  - Phone number field has US phone number filtering
  - Email field only accepts gmail accounts
  - First Name and Last Name fields only take 1 letter per field
  - There are only 6 characters allowed for each name type
  - DOB day, month, and year is randomized
  - The description field has a 1000 character minimum and maximim requirement
